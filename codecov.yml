# Note, this is a known security violation. Currently Forks of the
# repo cannot use our CODECOV CI/CD token, other options were considered
# before this approach. Permissions are not set that we can turn off
# codecov token requirement, and Kitware permissions don't allow
# for secret sharing to forked repositories. In the case that this
# becomes problematic, this token can get removed and regenerated.
